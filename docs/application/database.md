How the Database Management Files Work Together
The database management system in your project is structured with several files that work together to provide a robust, centralized database access layer. Let me explain how these 6 files interact:

Overview of Files and Their Roles
database_manager.py - The core class that manages the SQLite database
voltage_drop_service.py - A specialized service that uses the database for voltage drop calculations
database_tools.py - Utility tools for database maintenance and operations
data_store.py - A higher-level data access layer with in-memory caching and Qt signals
init_database.py - Script to initialize the database
manage_db.py - Command-line tool for database management operations
How They Work Together
1. Core Database Layer (DatabaseManager)
database_manager.py contains a singleton class that:

Manages the connection to the SQLite database
Creates the database schema if it doesn't exist
Handles database versioning and migrations
Provides basic query execution methods
Loads reference data into tables
Manages backups and restoration
This is the foundation that all other files build upon.

2. Specialized Services (VoltageDropService)
voltage_drop_service.py is a domain-specific service that:

Uses DatabaseManager to access required data
Provides methods specific to voltage drop calculations
Caches some data in memory for performance
Implements business logic around cable selection and validation
3. Database Maintenance (DatabaseTools)
database_tools.py provides higher-level database operations:

Table information retrieval
Import/export functionality
Vacuum and optimization operations
Custom query execution
Builds on DatabaseManager for connection management
4. Application Data Layer (DataStore)
data_store.py offers:

Qt-compatible signals for data change notifications
In-memory data caching
Fallback mechanisms if database operations fail
Higher-level data access methods
Uses DatabaseManager for persistence
5. Database Initialization (init_database.py)
init_database.py is a simple script that:

Creates the database if it doesn't exist
Ensures required tables are created
Populates reference data
Uses DatabaseManager to perform these operations
6. Command-Line Management (manage_db.py)
manage_db.py provides:

Command-line interface for database operations
Query execution
Backup and restore functionality
Data import/export
Database information display
Uses DatabaseManager and DatabaseTools
Data Flow
The application initializes by creating the database if needed (using init_database.py)
Components like VoltageDropService request DatabaseManager instances
DatabaseManager handles connections and query execution
Higher-level components like DataStore may cache results from database queries
Database maintenance is performed through manage_db.py or DatabaseTools
Singleton Pattern
The DatabaseManager uses the singleton pattern to ensure only one instance manages the database connection, preventing conflicts and connection leaks. Other classes request this instance through the get_instance() method.

Error Handling and Recovery
The system includes error handling and recovery mechanisms:

Connection pooling with thread-local storage
Database verification and repair
Fallback to default values if database operations fail
Logging of errors for troubleshooting
This structured approach provides a robust foundation for your application's data management needs.
