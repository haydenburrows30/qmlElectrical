Calculates the calculated padding resistance using the formula (2000 - loop_resistance) / 2
Finds the best combination of standard resistors (500, 260, 130, 65, 35) to match this value
Displays the combination with a clear format (e.g., "500 + 65" or "2Ã—260 + 35 = 555")
Shows this information in both the UI and the exported PDF
