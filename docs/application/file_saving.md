Current Architecture Strengths
Clear Separation of Responsibilities:

Python (Backend): Handles complex calculations, file operations, and data processing
QML (Frontend): Focuses on user interface, visualization, and user interaction
Simplified Signal-Based Communication:

Your exportComplete signal provides a standardized way for Python to notify QML about operation results
QML can react appropriately with success/error messages without needing to know implementation details
Encapsulated File Operations:

The Python backend handles all file dialog operations and file saving
This avoids complexity in QML and ensures consistent file handling across the application
Reusable Components:

The MessagePopup component in QML provides a consistent way to show success/error messages
The Python FileSaver class offers standardized file operations that any calculator can use
Benefits of This Approach
Maintainability: When file handling logic changes, you only need to update it in one place (Python backend)

Cross-Platform Compatibility: File path handling (especially with differences between Windows and Unix) is managed in Python where it's easier to handle

Performance: Computationally intensive tasks are handled by Python, which is more efficient for data processing than JavaScript in QML

Testability: Backend logic can be unit tested independently of the UI

Scalability: As your application grows, this separation will make it easier to add new features without complexity explosion

This pattern follows the common Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, where:

Model: Your Python calculator classes
View: QML UI components
Controller: The signal/slot connections and Python methods that respond to user actions
For future development, you could consider further refinements like introducing a dedicated ViewModel layer, but the current architecture is already well-structured and a valid approach for your goals.
