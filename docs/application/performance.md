# Qt/QML Performance Optimization

These changes should significantly improve your application's performance on Windows by:

- Using hardware acceleration when available instead of always using software rendering
- Implementing automatic detection of the best available renderer (native OpenGL, ANGLE/DirectX, or software fallback)
- Enabling disk caching for faster startup
- Adding command-line options to easily test different rendering backends
- Optimizing the render loop for better performance when changing screens
- Pre-allocating texture memory to reduce stuttering

You can test different renderers by using command-line arguments like `--renderer=angle` or `--renderer=desktop` to see which one works best on your Windows systems.

## Testing Requirements

### Windows Testing

For comprehensive testing of the rendering backends, you will need access to a Windows machine to test the following:

- Native OpenGL support (`--renderer=desktop`)
- ANGLE/DirectX backend (`--renderer=angle`) 
- Software rendering fallback (`--renderer=software`)

### Cross-Platform Testing

While a Windows machine is ideal for testing Windows-specific optimizations, you can:

1. Use virtualization tools like VirtualBox or VMware to run Windows in a virtual machine
2. Use Wine on Linux to run the application (with limitations)
3. Use remote desktop to a Windows machine for testing
4. Use CI/CD pipelines with Windows runners for automated testing

For best results, test on actual Windows hardware with different GPU configurations, as virtualized environments may not accurately represent real-world graphics performance.

### Monitoring Performance

To measure the impact of different rendering backends:

1. Track application startup time
2. Measure frame rates during screen transitions
3. Monitor CPU and GPU usage
4. Test on lower-end Windows machines to ensure good performance across different hardware configurations

The automatic detection should select the optimal renderer for most systems, but manual testing with different command-line options can help identify the best configuration for specific hardware.
