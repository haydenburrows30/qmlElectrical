        "• Level shifting for ADC inputs\n" +
            "• Reference voltage generation\n" +
            "• Biasing circuits\n" +
            "• Attenuators\n" +
            "• Potential dividers for measurement"
            "<b>Note:</b> For high impedance loads, the output voltage closely follows the theoretical value. " +
            "For low impedance loads, loading effects must be considered."
